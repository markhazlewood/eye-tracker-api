An API written in Java for establishing connections, configuring, calibrating, and receiving data from various eye tracking systems. Currently supported and tested systems include SMI iViewX RED250 and ITU GazeTracker. Support for Mirametrix has started but is not yet complete.

The goal of this project is to provide a common software interface to eye tracking systems and promote the establishment of a standard gaze data format.
